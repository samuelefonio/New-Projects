# Cluster analysis for Iris data set

This is a personal project that wanted to deppen different aspects of cluster analysis (CA).  
In particular we deal with hierarchical algorithms and k-means.   
For the hierarchical algorithms we used standard library packages and only agglomerative algorithms. We compared the different distances and their mixed performance on the trivial Iris data set,
to detect which was the best performing mix in order to differentiate between the species.
For the k-means we just performed the kmeans() function with different algorithms, getting better results than hierarchical ones, with all the different methods present.
