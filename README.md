# Projects
This is the repository of my projects. Projects can be academical or personal.
Academical ones have been completed during my (current) Master degree in Stochastics and Data science, at Univerisity of Turin, Italy. All of them were completed in group, and the names of the components can be shown in the report file and/or in the code file.

The academical R projects were made during the course "Multivariate statistical analysis". 

For each R project there are 4 type of files present: 
- the final report in pdf;
- The Rmd file;
- the code file used for the report;
- an additional code file (almost) entirely done by me in which I converted the standard library plots into ggplots. 

The data sets are not present, since they were provided by our professor as academical material and they could be affected by copyright.

The academical Python projects were made for examination of the course "Database and Algorithms" (Algorithms part).

Personal projects don't have several files, since they were done for personal interest.
