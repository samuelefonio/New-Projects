# Projects
This is the repository of my projects. Projects can be academical or personal.  

Academical ones have been completed during my Master degree in Stochastics and Data science, at Univerisity of Turin, Italy. All of them were completed in group, and the names of the components can be shown in the report file and/or in the code file.  

Personal projects were done following my personal interest and learning purposes.
