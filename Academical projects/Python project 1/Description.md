This project has been done for the course of Database and Algorithm (Algorithm part).  
We had to choose an algorithmic problem and solve it in different ways, comparing the time and space performances.  
It was done in couple but I managed the coding part and part of the report.  
We have choosen the problem of detecting an Eulerian path inside a connected and undirected graph.  
We performed two algorithms in different ways (iterative and recursive) and the most performing algorithms implementing data structures made by myself.
All the details are in the report file.  
This repository contains:  
- setup_1.py : The setup used for the implementation of Fleury's and "general" Hierholzer's algortims
- setup_2.py : The setup used for the Hierholzer's algorithm (best performing)
- Examples.ipynb : The set of examples on which we performed our algorithm
- A final report in which we discussed the problem and its solution
