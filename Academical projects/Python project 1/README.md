# Description
We had to choose an algorithmic problem and solve it in different ways, comparing the time and space performances.  
It was done in couple but I managed the coding part and part of the report.  
We have choosen the problem of detecting an Eulerian path inside a connected and undirected graph.  
We performed two algorithms in different ways (iterative and recursive) and the most performing algorithm implementing a data structure made by myself.
All the details are in the report file.  
Inside this project are present:
- Time and complexity analysis;
- Algorithm study and understanding;
- Comparison between performances, theoretical and practical.
