# Overview

This is an overview of all the academical projects I have done during my master degree.   

For each R project there are 4 type of files present: 
- the final report in pdf;
- The Rmd file;
- the code file used for the report;
- an additional code file (version2) almost entirely done by me in which I converted the standard library plots into ggplots. 

The data sets are not present, since they were provided by our professor as academical material and they could be affected by copyright. 

The academical Python project was made for examination of the course "Database and Algorithms" (Algorithms part).
