# Overview

This is an overview of all the academical projects I have done during my master degree.   

R project 1 was done in group (whose components' names can be present or not inside the files) and present 4 files: 
- the final report in pdf;
- The Rmd file;
- the code file used for the report;
- an additional code file (version2) almost entirely done by me in which I converted the standard library plots into ggplots. 

R project 2 was done in group (whose components' names can be present or not inside the files) and presents 3 files:
- the final report in pdf;
- The Rmd file;
- the code file used for the report;

Since in the R project 2 plots were not present in large number I decided to add the alternatives using ggplot2 directly in the R file.

The data sets are not present, since they were provided by our professor as academical material and they could be affected by copyright. 

The academical Python project was made for examination of the course "Database and Algorithms" (Algorithms part) and was done in couple. I managed the coding part.  
It contains:
- setup_1.py : The setup used for the implementation of Fleury's and "general" Hierholzer's algorithms;
- setup_2.py : The setup used for the Hierholzer's algorithm (best performing);
- Examples.ipynb : The set of examples on which we performed our algorithm;
- A final report in which we discussed the problem and its solution.
