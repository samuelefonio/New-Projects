# R project 2

This project was focused on two types of analysis:

- Factor analysis (FA);
- Discriminant analysis (DA).

They were performed on different data sets (always not available for copyright reasons).  
The exercises were focused on:

- Interpretate factors and understand the importance of rotation in factor analysis;
- Use of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to "discriminate" between 6 type of glass;
- Implement a 10-Fold Cross Validation (CV);
- comparison between reduced-rank LDA in the CV;
- Interpretation and comparison through training errors and CV errors.  

The most interesting and detailed analysis is the discriminant analysis, since it involved different techniques and it requested non-trivial tools.   

About the Fold Cross Validation method: we tought that the requested analysis using a given partition was too far from the reality, so we added a part with a random simulation.
