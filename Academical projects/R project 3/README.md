# Description of R project 3

This project was completed for the course of "Statistical Machine learning" and it is about credit risk management. In particular we explore different prediction 
techniques to predict if a client will do default or not with the information we have about him/her.  
The data are available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients and are about a Taiwanese bank.
The techniques used are :  

- Logistic regression (in different fashions: basic model, undersampled model, with Lasso and Ridge penalties)  
- KNN
- Support Vector Machines
